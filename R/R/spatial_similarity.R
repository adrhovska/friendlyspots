#' Spatial similarity between spatial transcriptomics samples
#'
#' @param samples Named list of data frames, one per sample, with columns: `x`,
#'   `y` (positions of spots/cells in any unit, e.g. pixels or micrometres,
#'   consistent between samples); `label` (e.g. cell type).
#' @param normalize Divide each sample's connection counts by their total to
#'   control for sample size.
#' @param pools Optional named list mapping pool names to sample names;
#'   connection counts are summed within each pool.
#' @param only_transitions If `TRUE`, only count connections between spots with
#'   distinct labels (i.e. borders); does not count connections between spots
#'   with the same label.
#' @param neighborhood Definition of the neighbourhood of each spot/cell:
#'   `"radius"` selects all within `radius`; `"knn"` selects the `k` nearest
#'   (symmetric: both are included in each other's neighborhood if either is
#'   among the other's nearest); or `"delaunay"` selects those surrounding it by
#'   Delaunay triangulation, dropping links longer than `radius`. The default,
#'   `"auto"`, uses `"radius"` if the positions lie on a grid (at least 75% of
#'   nearest-neighbor distances within 10% of their median) and `"delaunay"`
#'   otherwise, with a message saying which was used.
#' @param radius Neighborhood radius for `"radius"`, or maximum link length for
#'   `"delaunay"`, in the units of `x` and `y`. By default, set from the
#'   spacing of the data: set to the median distance from each spot/cell to its
#'   nearest neighbor over all samples, multiplied by 1.2 for `"radius"` or 3
#'   for `"delaunay"`. Used to make neighborhoods wider or narrower.
#' @param k Number of nearest neighbors for `neighborhood = "knn"`. Ties are
#'   broken arbitrarily.
#' @details Under default settings, the neighbourhoods of each sample's
#'   spots/cells depend on technology:
#'   * Visium spots: six immediate neighbors.
#'   * Visium HD bins: four side neighbors. Set `radius` to 1.5 times the
#'     bin size to add the diagonals.
#'   * Segmented cells (Xenium, or Visium HD with cell segmentation): the cells
#'     surrounding them, ignoring links across gaps.
#'
#'   Positions can be the pixel or micrometre coordinates from Space Ranger or
#'   Xenium outputs, as long as all samples use the same units. As the spacing
#'   is taken over all samples, don't mix samples in different units or from
#'   different technologies.
#' @return Symmetric similarity matrix with values in \[0, 1\], or `NA` for
#'   samples with no neighboring spots when `normalize = TRUE`.
